                  After 6 years of working in vocational ministry, I decided to
                  change career paths to pursue my passion for coding. During my
                  spare time I learned to code through Codecademy and found
                  myself more engaged and fulfilled than my actual career.
                  <br /> <br />
                  I enrolled in Georgia Tech's coding boot camp in order to
                  become a full stack web developer. Although the pace is
                  incredibly fast and the course is challenging, I am loving
                  every minute of it. Collaborating with my cohort members has
                  become my favorite aspect of the boot camp.
                  <br /> <br />
                  My hope is to one day merge my skills of leadership, teaching,
                  and coding along with my passion to bring people together in
                  order help people who can't help themselves.
                  <br /> <br />
                  In my spare time I like to study the Bible, train my miniature
                  Aussie, go on hikes with my beautiful wife, and bring people
                  together with games and deep conversation.
