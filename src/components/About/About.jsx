                    I am a full stack web developer with a passion for

                    After 6 rewarding years of working in vocational ministry, 
                    I decided to pursue my passion for coding in order to solve
                    problems with technology.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I earned a certificate in full stack web development from 
                    the Georgia Institute of Technology. During the course, I 
                    earned a reputation for being a team leader on group projects.
                    My strengths include strategizing for efficiency, communicating 
                    and organizing all of the details, and synergizing my team. 
                    I have hands-on experience in building full stack applications,
                    including custom user authentication and authorization.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Does your company or organization need help developing or 
                    maintaining a website? I'll apply my skills in leadership, 
                    interpersonal relationships, and web development to meet all
                    of your needs.
                    <br /> <br />
                    In my spare time I like to study the Bible, train my
                    miniature Aussie, go on hikes with my beautiful wife, and
                    bring people together with games and deep conversation.
